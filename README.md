#BCN3D MOVEO

This is the repository that contains the CAD files, the STL files, the user manual (with the assembly manual), the firmware, and the Bill of Materials of the BCN3D Moveo.
BCN3D Technologies keeps taking important steps in order to achieve his goal of bringing the digital manufacturing technology to everyone. In this occasion we are presenting the BCN3D Moveo, a robotic arm design from scratch and developed by our engineers in collaboration with the Departament d’Ensenyament from the Generalitat de Catalunya. Its structure is fully printed using additive manufacturing technologies and its electronics are controlled by the software Arduino.
